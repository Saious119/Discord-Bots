## Terry Davis Bot
### Description 
A Bot that sends quotes said by late programmer Terry Davis, inventor of TempleOS, whenever his name is mentioned. **Warning** it is important to note that Terry Davis has said some things that other may find offensive, this is not representative of my beliefs, however I do find the quotes to be occassionally humorous and representative of Terry Davis.
